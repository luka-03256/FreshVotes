Typically web application consists of three so to speak main components
	1 controller - which handles all of the requests sent when client tries to connect
	(gain access) to our web application, also controller makes decision what to do (how to react)
	on particular request
	- controller send request off to the service which stands in between of business logic
	2 service typically does the work ( business logic )
	- service will fetch data from repository, database(do some work calculation, extraction)
	 do something with that data and pass back
	to controller which will eventually send it to view
	3 view - html(hyper text markup language) of end user, what client is looking at
